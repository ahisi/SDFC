 abstract = {L-moments are expectations of certain linear combinations of order statistics. They can be defined for any random variable whose mean exists and form the basis of a general theory which covers the summarization and description of theoretical probability distributions, the summarization and description of observed data samples, estimation of parameters and quantiles of probability distributions, and hypothesis tests for probability distributions. The theory involves such established procedures as the use of order statistics and Gini's mean difference statistic, and gives rise to some promising innovations such as the measures of skewness and kurtosis described in Section 2, and new methods of parameter estimation for several distributions. The theory of L-moments parallels the theory of (conventional) moments, as this list of applications might suggest. The main advantage of L-moments over conventional moments is that L-moments, being linear functions of the data, suffer less from the effects of sampling variability: L-moments are more robust than conventional moments to outliers in the data and enable more secure inferences to be made from small samples about an underlying probability distribution. L-moments sometimes yield more efficient parameter estimates than the maximum likelihood estimates.},

abstract = {The three-parameter generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution has found wide application for describing annual floods, rainfall, wind speeds, wave heights, snow depths, and other maxima. Previous studies show that small-sample maximum-likelihood estimators (MLE) of parameters are unstable and recommend L moment estimators. More recent research shows that method of moments quantile estimators have for −0.25 < κ < 0.30 smaller root-mean-square error than L moments and MLEs. Examination of the behavior of MLEs in small samples demonstrates that absurd values of the GEV-shape parameter κ can be generated. Use of a Bayesian prior distribution to restrict κ values to a statistically/physically reasonable range in a generalized maximum likelihood (GML) analysis eliminates this problem. In our examples the GML estimator did substantially better than moment and L moment quantile estimators for − 0.4 ≤ κ ≤ 0.},

abstract = {The generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution is widely used for modeling and characterizing extremes. It is a flexible three-parameter distribution that combines three extreme-value distributions within a single framework: the Gumbel, Frechet, and Weibull. Common methods used for estimating the GEV parameters are the method of maximum likelihood and the method of L-moments. This paper generalizes the mixed maximum likelihood and L-moments GEV estimation procedures proposed by Morrison and Smith (2002) and derives the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators. Analytic expressions are given for the asymptotic covariance matrices in a number of important cases, including the estimators proposed by Morrison and Smith (2002). These expressions are verified by simulation and the efficiencies of the various estimators established. The asymptotic results are compared to those obtained for small to medium-size samples by simulation with the estimated parameters and quantiles assessed for accuracy and bias. Using simplified constraints for the support of the log likelihood, computational strategies and graphical tools are developed which lead to computationally efficient, numerically robust, estimation procedures suitable for automatic batch processing of many data sets. The methods are illustrated by application to annual maximum rainfall data at a large number of New Zealand locations. For Wellington, 24 h annual maximum rainfall over the period 1940–1999 is also considered within each phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation.},

abstract = {This paper considers use of the generalized Pareto ∥GP) distribution with a Poisson model for arrivals to describe peaks over a threshold. This yields a three-parameter generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for the annual maximum series. Maximum likelihood estimates of the GP shape parameter к can result in absurd estimates in small samples. These problems are resolved by addition of a prior distribution on к yielding a generalized maximum likelihood estimator. Results show that a three- parameter partial duration series (PDS) analysis yields quantile estimators with the same precision as an annual maximum series (AMS) analysis when the generalized maximum likelihood (GML) GP and GEV estimators are adopted. For к ≤ 0 the GML quantile estimators with both PDS and AMS have the best performance among the quantile estimators examined (moments, L moments, and GML). The precision of flood quantiles derived from a PDS analysis is insensitive to the arrival rate λ, so that a year of PDS data is generally worth about as much as a year of AMS data when estimating the 100-year flood.},

abstract = "The paper presents a methodology for estimating high quantiles of distributions of daily temperature in a non-stationary context, based on peaks-over-threshold analysis with a time-dependent threshold expressed in terms of regression quantiles. The extreme value models are applied to estimate 20-yr return values of maximum daily temperature over Europe in transient global climate model (GCM) simulations for the 21st century. A comparison of scenarios of changes in the 20-yr return temperatures based on the non-stationary peaks-over-threshold models with conventional stationary models is performed. It is demonstrated that the application of the stationary extreme value models in temperature data from GCM scenarios yields results that may be to a large extent biased, while the non-stationary models lead to spatial patterns that are robust and enable one to detect areas where the projected warming in the tail of the distribution of daily temperatures is largest. The method also allows splitting the projected warming of extremely high quantiles into two parts that reflect change in the location and scale of the distribution of extremes, respectively. Spatial patterns of the two components differ significantly in the examined climate change projections over Europe."
